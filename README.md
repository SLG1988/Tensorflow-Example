# Tensorflow-Example
An implementation of a custom model function for deep learning in combination with the Estimator API, using Google's Tensorflow.

This example shows how to:
-build a custom deep learning model function with the estimator api
-use a custom decaying learning rate
-log custom metrics during training, evaluation and prediction
-print those metrics
-save custom training metrics for visualization in Tensorboard
